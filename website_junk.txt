one of the core themes of this work is the role of chirality (handedness). 

In our research group we study chiral iridiscent structures with structural colour (which you may be familar with as iridiescence). I characterise the visual appearance of these structures using techniques such as angle-resolved optical spectroscopy and hyperspectral imaging. Build circular dichrosim setup. 

I also characterise samples at the nanoscale using electron microscopy (SEM and TEM). 

More generally, I'm interested in photonics, self-assembly and soft matter physics.
