Cellulose is a naturally-occurring polymer. It's the most abundant biopolymer on Earth, as it's used to strengthen the walls of plant cells. Cellulose can therefore be found in many plants. 

Cellulose is very difficult to decompose, which is why it's also a major component of fibre (roughage). We therefore have to use quite aggressive treatment (cooking it in highly concentrated acid at high temperatures).

It's interesting that we can produce colour using this twisted arrangement of rods, because we observe very similar structures in the natural world. For instance, the fruits of plants of the Pollia genus (also known as the marble berry) appear shiny and intensely blue in colour due to a very similar arrangement. It's not clear whether this similarity is just a coincidence, or if it tells us something fundamental about the chirality of cellulose fibres. 




Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are rod-shaped nanoparticles that can be extracted from natural sources of cellulose, such as wood or cotton. 



one of the core themes of this work is the role of chirality (handedness). 

In our research group we study chiral iridiscent structures with structural colour (which you may be familar with as iridiescence). I characterise the visual appearance of these structures using techniques such as angle-resolved optical spectroscopy and hyperspectral imaging. Build circular dichrosim setup. 

I also characterise samples at the nanoscale using electron microscopy (SEM and TEM). 

More generally, I'm interested in photonics, self-assembly and soft matter physics.
