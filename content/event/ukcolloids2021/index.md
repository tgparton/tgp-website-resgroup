summary: "Influence of ultrasonication on cellulose nanocrystal photonic films"

abstract: "The chiral self-assembly of nanoscale building blocks is a fascinating example of the emergence of large-scale structure from the properties of individual sub-units, and an attractive approach to create nanomaterials with bespoke properties. Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are bio-sourced rod-like nanoparticles that form a lyotropic chiral nematic (cholesteric) liquid crystal phase in colloidal suspension. The helicoidal arrangement of CNCs can be preserved upon drying to create solid films with structural colour, offering a way to produce colourants from an abundant sustainable biomaterial. \n\n CNCs consistently form a stable left-handed chiral nematic phase under a range of experimental conditions, but the origin of their mesophase chirality is unclear. Although the morphology of individual CNCs is believed to play a role, most particles are not strongly twisted, and samples exhibit a wide distribution of particle sizes and shapes. \n\n In this work, we used high-intensity ultrasound to gradually tune the size and shape of CNCs, and performed advanced statistical analysis of particle morphology based on transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. We establish quantitative relationships between colloidal liquid crystalline behaviour and the morphological distribution of CNC particles. In particular, we show that the chiral nematic pitch arises from the presence of “bundles” (clusters of laterally-bound cellulose crystallites) in the suspension, indicating that these bundles act as colloidal chiral dopants."
