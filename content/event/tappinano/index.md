summary: Influence of ultrasonication on cellulose nanocrystal photonic films

abstract: Treatment of cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) suspensions with high-intensity ultrasound is a well-established technique for modifying their colloidal and rheological behaviour. For CNC photonic films, sonication has been shown to increase the chiral nematic pitch, resulting in a red-shift in the peak reflection wavelength of the dried film. Despite the popularity of ultrasonication as a preparation method for CNCs in photonic applications, the way in which it reduces the chirality of the CNC chiral nematic phase is not fully understood.

In this work, we investigated the changes in CNC morphology and surface chemistry induced by ultrasonication, and their consequences for CNC chiral self-assembly into photonic films. Extraction of the morphology of individual CNCs from their outlines in TEM images enabled advanced shape analysis that elucidated the lateral breakage mechanism of CNCs under ultrasonication. An exploration of CNC size under diverse ultrasonication treatments shows the total sonication energy per suspension volume, rather than energy per CNC dry mass, is the most consistent metric for ultrasonication dose. 

Correlating CNC size statistics with pitch values suggest that the reduction in CNC chirality induced by sonication cannot be simply explained by changes in CNC length and aspect ratio. In particular, excessively sonicated CNCs tended towards a constant rod length and formed a film with no discernible pitch, suggesting the chirality of individual CNC crystallites is not the primary origin of the chirality of CNC assemblies. We therefore interpret our findings in terms of twisted CNC aggregates acting as chiral dopants, which are broken up by increasing sonication.
