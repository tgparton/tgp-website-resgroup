abstract: Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are bio-sourced colloidal particles able to self-assemble into chiral photonic structures, but the origin of their mesophase chirality remains unclear. Moreover, the lack of statistically significant characterisation of the particle size and shape make it challenging to apply predictive models. In this work, nanoparticle shape metrology was implemented to track morphological changes induced by ultrasonication, enabling quantitative comparison of individual particle morphology and ensemble behaviour both in suspensions and cast films. The chiral nematic pitch was found to rely on the presence of crystallite bundles, a ubiquitous feature of CNC suspensions not previously associated with their chiral self-assembly. The bundles have an effective helical twisting power of β = 4μm−1 when modelled as chiral dopants, analogous to those used in molecular liquid crystals. These results indicate that CNC crystallites bundles are the missing link in the hierarchical transfer of chirality from the molecular to colloidal level.
