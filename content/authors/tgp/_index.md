I'm a third-year PhD student in the [Bio-inspired Photonics Group](https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/group/vignolini/) at the University of Cambridge. My core PhD research is focussed on the [self-assembly of cellulose nanocrystals]({{< ref "res_int/_index.md" >}}) as a way to produce structural colour from sustainable materials. 

one of the core themes of this work is the role of chirality (handedness). 

In our research group we study chiral iridiscent structures with structural colour (which you may be familar with as iridiescence). I characterise the visual appearance of these structures using techniques such as angle-resolved optical spectroscopy and hyperspectral imaging. Build circular dichrosim setup. 

I also characterise samples at the nanoscale using electron microscopy (SEM and TEM). 

More generally, I'm interested in photonics, self-assembly and soft matter physics.


As a undergraduate I studied Natural Sciences (Physics and Physical Chemistry) at University College London (UCL), including a year of study abroad at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). I initially pursued my interest in theoretical high-energy particle physics with an internship at CERN, and a Masters of Advanced Studies (MASt/Part III) in the Department of Applied Maths and Theoretical Physics (DAMTP) at the University of Cambridge. After deciding not to pursue a PhD in high-energy physics, I changed research direction, and returned to Cambridge as part of the NanoDTC MRes+PhD programme in 2017.
