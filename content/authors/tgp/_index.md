# comment? 

I'm a third-year PhD student in the [Bio-inspired Photonics Group](https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/group/vignolini/) at the University of Cambridge. My PhD research is focussed on the self-assembly of cellulose nanocrystals as a way to produce structural colour from sustainable materials. 

In our research group we study chiral iridiscent structures with structural colour (which you may be familar with as iridiescence). I characterise the visual appearance of these structures using techniques such as angle-resolved optical spectroscopy. Build circular dichrosim setup. 

I spend most of my time in the lab, using optical microscopes, electron microscopes, building laser setups, spectroscopy. 

More generally, I'm interested in photonics, self-assembly.



My research interests include photonics, soft matter physics and nanoscale self-assembly.
